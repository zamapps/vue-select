> Everything you wish the HTML `<select>` element could do, wrapped
> up into a lightweight, extensible Vue component.

Vue Select is a feature rich select/dropdown/typeahead component. It provides a default
template that fits most use cases for a filterable select dropdown. The component is designed to be as
lightweight as possible, while maintaining high standards for accessibility,
developer experience, and customization.

<div style="max-width:25rem; margin: 0 auto; padding: 1rem 0;">
  <country-select />  
</div>

Vue Select aims to be as lightweight as possible, while maintaining high standards for accessibility,
developer experience, and customization. Huge thanks to the [sponsors](sponsors.md) and
[contributors](contributors.md) that make Vue Select possible!
